# Indianapolis_Food_Trucks

In this project, Indianapolis Food Trucks were investigated using a dataset and basic analysis tools to inform the creation of a weekend travel itinerary. Within this project, there is a total of five other files. 

Indianapolis_Food_Trucks_Final_Data.csv is the cleaned version of the original web-scraped data. This is the csv file that our main dataframe, indi_foodtrucks was read in from.

Indianapolis_Foodtrucks.Rmd is the R markdown file used to format the report and generate the analysis.

Indianapolis_Foodtrucks.html is the html version of the knitted report.

Indianapolis_Foodtrucks.pdf is the pdf version of the knitted report.

Indianapolis_Trip_Itinerary is an Excel file representing the basic travel plans for the two-day weekend. It contains information about several food trucks and two maps corresponding to the Saturday and Sunday routes.

When trying to work through the R markdown file on your own, you might need to change the initial loading of the dataset based on where you store the downloaded csv dataset and individual device specifications.
